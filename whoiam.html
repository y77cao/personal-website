My interest towards computer science began when I was an exchange student in 
New Mexico, the United States in 2013. I took the advanced technology course at school,
 which made me realize the charm of programming. And I decided to do the further study 
 in this field in University of Waterloo.

 Travelling is one indispensable part of my life. I have been to over ten countries all 
 over the world: Australia, US, Japan, Thailand,etc. And I am still looking for more unique and unforgettable experience.
 Travelling broadens my horizons. It is also a good way to jump out of my comfort zone and enjoy different lifestyle.
 I consider my life as an adventure. Never stop discovering:)! </p>
